## Namics: 

Hybrid SCF-MD simulation tool. Package under development.

Developers: F.A.M.Leermakers, R.Varadharajan.

TODO 10-8-2018
-fix cuda for 3d
-mesodyn
	noise in 3d
	grand canonical simulations (renormalise densities periodically) 
	multiple states
-multiple states in namics
	thermodynamics
	restart
	variate
	output of all kinds of computables
-layer analysis (first moments, second moment)
-SOT evaulation Gibbs plane etcetera
-optimise namics for segments that are identical (not unique): these need no new iteration variables.
-dendrimers (symmetric)
-dendrimers (asymmetric)
-comb 
-rings (with tether) 
-semi-flexibility
-force ensemble
-grit refinement in 2D and 3D
-LBFGS implementation in newton
-Trunctated newton 
-fix Picard method
-BD-SCF hybrid
	fixed mobility
	Quasi-Newton mobility
-Cleng (with MC)
	dynamics
-Teng (with MC)
	dynamics
-steady states 
	1D
	2D and 3D
